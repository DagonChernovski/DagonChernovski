(not updated for a long time)

- 👋 Hi, I’m @DagonChernovski. I am a student who attends IT education and is a computer programming enthusiast.
- 👀 I became interested in program writing in 2015, when I was a child. Now I am an adult, a pretty amateur code writer if we evaluate it by standards.
- 🌱 In current moment, I am learning LISP, SQL, Java, Python, postponed: <s>C++, C# </s>.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some projects i don't know yet.
- 📫 How to reach me: Discord - dagon_was_taken. 
- I prefer not to share much information about my irl self :)
